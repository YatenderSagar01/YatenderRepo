HTML Learning Project
This repository contains a simple HTML5 practice project that demonstrates the fundamental elements of web development. It is structured as a learning exercise to understand HTML tags, semantics, and webpage structure.
Features Covered
Head Section
Declares <!DOCTYPE html> for HTML5 compliance.
Uses <meta charset="UTF-8"> to support all characters.
Includes viewport settings with <meta name="viewport"> for responsive design.
Defines a <title> tag for the webpage name.
Headings
Demonstrates headings from <h1> to <h6> with different text sizes.
Paragraphs and Formatting
<p>: Adds placeholder text for paragraph formatting.
<br> and <hr>: Used for line breaks and horizontal rules.
Text Formatting Tags:
<strong> for bold
<em> for italic
<ins> for underline
<del> and <s> for strike-through text
Links
Absolute Link: Example using Google.
Relative Link: Opens a local file (main.html) in a new tab.
Images
Demonstrates the difference between:
Absolute image links (external URL).
Relative image links (local project images).
Includes alt tag for accessibility.
Lists
Unordered List (<ul>) with custom type="square".
Ordered List (<ol>) with Roman numerals (type="i").
Description List (<dl>) with <dt> (term) and <dd> (definition).
Table
A sample table with border:
<thead> defines the header row.
<tbody> contains data rows.
Code Practices and Notes
Comments (<!-- -->) explain each section for better readability.
Nested tags are demonstrated for creating multiple levels of lists.
Proper semantic tags are used instead of lower-ranked tags like <b>, <u>, etc.
External tools like Inspect and View Page Source are mentioned for debugging and learning.
Recommended Improvements
Use CSS styles instead of inline attributes like border="3" for tables.
Avoid using deprecated tags (<strike>, <b>, <u>). Prefer their semantic alternatives.
Maintain proper indentation for readability.
Close all open tags properly (</html> was incomplete).
Getting Started
